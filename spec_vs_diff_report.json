  "summary": "All three required changes (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3) appear to be implemented in the diff. The MessageBubble.tsx file summary explicitly confirms all Plan Y changes: share links zero-pad message.id to 9 digits, message ID spans use font-mono, and the Twitter embed container enforces 300px max-width. The index.css also includes a .twitter-embed-container iframe rule for the 300px constraint. No hallucinated features are evident.",
