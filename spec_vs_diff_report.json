  "summary": "The diff modifies MessageBubble.tsx to replace inline message action buttons with a context menu using a ContextMenu component (right-click on desktop). The file summary confirms all message actions (Reply, React, Share, Flag) are accessible via context menu with right-click on desktop and long-press on mobile. No CSS classes, Tailwind utilities, or visual styles appear to have been changed. The implementation appears to satisfy the core REQ-1 requirements based on available evidence, though the diff is truncated so some details cannot be fully verified.",

      "description": "Flag action added to the context menu",
      "reason": "The file summary explicitly states 'all message actions (Reply, React, Share, Flag) are accessible via a context menu'. The build request explicitly states as a non-goal 'Adding new actions to the context menu beyond what currently exists as buttons.' If Flag was not previously an inline button, adding it to the context menu is a hallucinated feature.",
