  "summary": "The diff shows that MessageBubble.tsx was modified to remove the visible message ID display from the chat bubble UI while preserving share/anchor functionality. The file summary explicitly confirms this: 'The visible message ID (#{message.messageId}) has been removed from the header row while all underlying share/anchor functionality remains intact.' The truncated diff does not show the full component code, but the file summary provides sufficient evidence that REQ-1 was implemented correctly.",
