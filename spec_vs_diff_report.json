  "summary": "The diff modifies MessageBubble.tsx to replace always-visible action buttons with a ContextMenu component (right-click on desktop, long-press on mobile) containing Reply, React, and Share actions. The implementation appears largely aligned with REQ-1, but a Flag action was also added to the context menu beyond the three requested actions.",

      "reason": "The build request explicitly states the menu must contain exactly the same three actions — Reply, React, and Share — and that no new message actions should be added beyond these three. The file summary explicitly mentions 'Flag actions' in the context menu.",
