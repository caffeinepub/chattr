  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 and REQ-2 with minor discrepancies. REQ-1 is fully implemented: URL detection via regex in MessageBubble, clickable links rendered with ExternalLink icon. REQ-2 is mostly implemented: modal intercepts link clicks, shows correct disclaimer text, has Cancel button, and has a button to open the link in a new tab. However, the Confirm button is labeled 'Continue' instead of 'Confirm' as specified.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "The modal must have a Confirm button (opens the link in a new tab) and a Cancel button (closes the modal without navigating).",
