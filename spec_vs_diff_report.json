The file summary for MessageBubble.tsx explicitly describes all four requirements being implemented: avatar aligned to the top (REQ-1), username font size increased to text-sm (REQ-2), timestamp moved inside the bubble (REQ-3), and native long-press/context menu suppressed (REQ-4). All four requirements appear to be addressed based on available evidence.",
