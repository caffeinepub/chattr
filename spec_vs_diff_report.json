  "summary": "The diff modifies MessageBubble.tsx and associated summary files. The frontend-file-summaries.txt explicitly states that action buttons (emoji, reply, pin) now use 'bg-muted/border-border styling for full visibility on hover' and confirms the message header order (Message ID → Timestamp → Username → Avatar) is preserved. This aligns with REQ-1's requirements to restore button visibility and styling while not reverting the layout reorder. The truncated MessageBubble.tsx diff prevents full verification of all button styling details, but available evidence is consistent with the requirement.",
