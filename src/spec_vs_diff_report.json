  "summary": "The diff shows that backend/main.mo was modified, but the changes are heavily truncated. The visible portion shows that authentication/authorization logic (AccessControl module) is still present and actively used in several functions (initializeAccessControl, getCallerUserRole, assignCallerUserRole, isCallerAdmin, deleteChatroomWithPassword). These functions still check caller permissions and trap on unauthorized access, directly contradicting REQ-1's requirement to remove all caller authorization checks. Due to truncation, I cannot verify whether other functions were properly modified or whether GIF functionality remains intact.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Remove or nullify all caller authorization checks in backend/main.mo to ensure all functions execute without authentication validation",
      "reason": "Multiple functions in main.mo still contain explicit caller authorization checks using AccessControl module. Functions like deleteChatroomWithPassword() still trap with 'Unauthorized: Only admins can delete chatrooms' error. The AccessControl module is still imported and used throughout the visible code.",
