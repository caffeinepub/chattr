  "summary": "Backend reset method appears to add admin authorization checks (contrary to requirements) and the diff includes modifications to extra non-requested files (frontend-file-summaries.txt, project_state.json). Due to truncation, it is not verifiable whether the reset fully clears all state/counters or whether the frontend tab/button wiring and cache refresh are fully implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Ensure the new backend reset method contains no caller principal checks and no authorization checks.",
      "reason": "The new resetData method explicitly reads `caller` and performs an AccessControl permission check, trapping if not admin, which violates the requirement of no caller/authorization checks.",

        "backend/main.mo"
      ]

      "requirement": "Reset must wipe all persisted application data (chatrooms, messages, reactions, active user tracking, user profiles) and reset ID counters (nextChatroomId/nextMessageId or equivalent).",
      "reason": "In the visible (truncated) portion of resetData, only `nextMessageId := 0;` is shown; there is no visible evidence of resetting `nextChatroomId` or clearing chatrooms/messages/reactions/activeUsers/userProfiles maps/collections.",
