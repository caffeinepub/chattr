  "summary": "The diff implements protections in React Query to keep previously fetched chatroom lists from being overwritten by transient empty results shortly after creation (via placeholderData and a post-create empty-result guard). However, the diff does not show any explicit logic ensuring chatroom creation reliably refreshes all relevant list queries (base, category-filtered, search) after creating a room.",

      "requirement": "Ensure chatroom creation triggers a reliable refresh of all relevant chatroom list views, including base list, category-filtered lists, and search lists, without requiring any user interaction.",
      "reason": "The diff shows query-side guarding/placeholderData to preserve previous results, but does not show any mutation-side invalidation/refetch logic tied to chatroom creation that would refresh ['chatrooms'], category-filtered, and search queries. The provided snippets only show list queries and pages consuming them; no creation-triggered queryClient.invalidateQueries/refetchQueries for the relevant keys is evidenced.",
