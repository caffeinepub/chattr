  "summary": "Diff adds client-side Giphy search utilities (config constant, fetch helper), a debouncing hook, and begins integrating Giphy state/handlers into AvatarPickerDialog. However, the diff snippet does not provide clear evidence that the avatar picker UI renders a searchable results list/grid, displays empty/error state messaging, and wires selection to close the dialog in the same way as upload (though handler exists). It also includes changes to non-requested meta files.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Users can search Giphy from the avatar picker and see a list/grid of results; selecting a result sets avatarUrl to the GIF URL via useUpdateAvatar(..., isPreset=false) and closes the dialog; show an English error/empty-state message on failure/no results while upload/remove still work; no style/layout changes to existing UI elements.",
      "reason": "While Giphy state and a selection handler are present, the provided truncated diff does not show any additive UI that renders the Giphy search input/results grid/list or displays the error/empty state message within the dialog, nor does it show that existing UI elements/className strings were preserved (cannot be verified from the truncated snippet).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/AvatarPickerDialog.tsx (truncated; shows giphy state + handleGiphySelect but not the results/empty-state UI)"
