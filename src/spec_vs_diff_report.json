  "summary": "The diff implements both requirements: REQ-1 adds lastActivity field to Chatroom backend type with migration logic and updates it on message/reaction operations, and REQ-2 updates the frontend ChatroomCard component to display the lastActivity timestamp. However, the diff evidence is incomplete (files truncated), preventing full verification of message and reaction update logic.",

      "description": "Migration module added to handle data migration from old Chatroom schema without lastActivity to new schema with lastActivity field",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly states 'Do not make any additional changes beyond updating the timestamp tracking and display'. Migration logic, while potentially necessary for deployment, was not requested and adds infrastructure beyond the core requirement.",
