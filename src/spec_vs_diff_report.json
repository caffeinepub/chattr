  "summary": "All requirements are implemented. The diff adds a global message ID counter in the backend, formats IDs as zero-padded 9-digit strings (expanding when needed), stores the ID as Text in the Message type, and displays the ID in the MessageBubble component. No authorization checks were added. A migration module was added to handle data type changes. No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",

      "description": "Migration module (backend/migration.mo) that transforms old message structures with Nat IDs to new Text IDs and converts reaction/reply maps from Nat-keyed to Text-keyed",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not mention data migration or handling existing messages. The migration module appears to be implementation infrastructure not requested in the spec.",
