  "summary": "The diff shows implementation of Giphy tab addition and removal of video/X posts tabs in MessageInput.tsx, with corresponding updates to project state. Backend changes appear unrelated to BuildRequest requirements. All requirements are implemented.",

      "description": "Backend modifications to main.mo file",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly states 'Do not modify the backend/main.mo file unless absolutely necessary' and constraints emphasize preservation of existing functionality. The diff shows backend/main.mo was modified, but the BuildRequest requirements (REQ-5 through REQ-8) are all frontend-only changes related to UI tab reorganization and client-side Giphy integration. No backend changes were necessary or requested.",
