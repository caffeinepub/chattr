  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to MessageInput.tsx and related documentation files. The component appears to have a character counter implementation (MAX_CHARS = 2000 and references to character counting logic), but the diff is truncated and does not show clear evidence of border removal or the complete character counter display implementation. The file summary indicates 'no top border on the container' and 'character counter display showing remaining characters', suggesting both requirements may be addressed, but the truncated diff prevents full verification.",
