However, because `ChatroomCard.tsx` is truncated, some acceptance-criteria details (e.g., explicit removal of the old under-title tag and explicit non-overlap logic with the LIVE badge) cannot be fully verified from the provided excerpt.",

      "description": "Enhanced dynamic thumbnail handling (YouTube/Twitch/Twitter/X thumbnail fetching including Twitter oEmbed requests and Twitch thumbnail availability probing) added to ChatroomCard beyond the requested category-overlay UI change.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks to reposition the existing category tag overlay within the thumbnail; it explicitly constrains this to a UI-only change and does not request new thumbnail fetching logic or external oEmbed fetching.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/ChatroomCard.tsx (adds Twitch thumbnail fetching via `getTwitchThumbnailUrl` and `new Image()` probe; adds Twitter oEmbed `fetch` to publish.twitter.com and parsing HTML for image src)",
