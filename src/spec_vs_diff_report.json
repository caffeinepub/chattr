  "summary": "The diff shows partial implementation of authentication removal and inline media controls, but evidence is incomplete due to truncation. REQ-1 (frontend authentication removal) and REQ-3 (inline image/GIF buttons) show implementation evidence, but REQ-2 (backend caller verification removal) cannot be fully verified from the truncated backend code.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Remove all caller verification checks from backend canister methods to make them publicly accessible",
      "reason": "The backend/main.mo file is truncated and still contains access control functions (initializeAccessControl, getCallerUserRole, assignCallerUserRole, isCallerAdmin, getCallerUserProfile) and AccessControl module imports. The truncation prevents verification that all methods have had caller checks removed and are fully public.",
