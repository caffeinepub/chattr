  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to `frontend/src/components/ChatArea.tsx`, but the provided truncation does not include the chatroom header/stats row markup, so the required `gap-2` spacing and LIVE badge repositioning cannot be verified from the evidence. Two non-requested meta/documentation files were also modified.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Update the chatroom header stats row in `frontend/src/components/ChatArea.tsx` so the horizontal gap between the message/reply count, view count, and category badge is 0.5rem (e.g., Tailwind `gap-2`).",
      "reason": "`ChatArea.tsx` is truncated before the header/stats row section; the diff excerpt does not show the container classes or layout for the message/view/category elements, so the `gap-2` change cannot be confirmed.",

      "requirement": "Move the LIVE indicator in `frontend/src/components/ChatArea.tsx` to appear to the right of the category badge in the same stats row, with 0.5rem horizontal gap; also render consistently when category is absent.",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt does not include the header/stats row JSX where the LIVE indicator is rendered/positioned; therefore the placement and spacing behavior cannot be verified.",
