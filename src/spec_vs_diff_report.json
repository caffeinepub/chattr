  "summary": "Backend change clearly enforces a hardcoded admin password in deleteChatroomWithPassword, and the frontend admin delete page includes a sessionStorage-based password gate. However, the diff summary does not provide evidence that getChatrooms() was modified to stop stripping data: URLs, nor that all non-admin backend operations now bypass AccessControl authorization checks.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Modify ONLY backend/main.mo inside public query func getChatrooms() so it no longer replaces chatroom.mediaUrl with null when it contains \"data:\", returning the stored mediaUrl unchanged.",
      "reason": "The provided backend/main.mo diff excerpt is truncated before any getChatrooms() implementation is shown, so there is no evidence that the data:-URL stripping logic was removed within getChatrooms() (or that the change was limited only to that function body).",

      "requirement": "Update backend/main.mo so all non-admin operations succeed regardless of AccessControl/caller authorization checks by removing or bypassing AccessControl.hasPermission/isAdmin or related blocking logic.",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt shows AccessControl state initialization and several AccessControl-exposing methods still present, but does not show any removal/bypass of authorization checks across non-admin operations (e.g., create chatroom, send message, profile ops, reactions). With truncation, there is insufficient evidence that these checks were neutralized.",

      "description": "Frontend React Query behavior changes unrelated to the admin password gate (e.g., normalized query keys, aggressive refetch, removal of empty-result rejection guards).",
      "reason": "REQ-16 only asks to keep the existing admin delete page password prompt and avoid adding new auth prompts for regular actions; it does not request broad React Query refetch/key/guard changes.",
