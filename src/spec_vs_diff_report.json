  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 by filtering out Creator messages without media in ChatArea.tsx. However, the requirement specifies modifying 'room card display logic' while the implementation modifies the chat message display logic within a room. This appears to be a misinterpretation of the requirement.",

      "requirement": "Modify the room card display logic to only show the Creator message for rooms that were created with media",
      "reason": "The implementation filters Creator messages in ChatArea.tsx (the chat interface inside a room), but REQ-1 explicitly states 'room card display logic' which refers to ChatroomCard.tsx (the preview cards shown in the lobby). No changes were made to ChatroomCard.tsx.",
