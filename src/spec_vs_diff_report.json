The requested UI updates (pill radius, button order, matched heights) are asserted in the modified summaries but cannot be directly verified from the truncated MessageInput.tsx excerpt. The constraint to limit changes strictly to the message input area appears violated by unrelated modifications to frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json.",
