# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove all authentication requirements and make the application fully anonymous with inline media controls.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove Internet Identity authentication from the frontend
- Remove all caller verification checks from backend canister methods
- Display image upload and GIF picker buttons inline in the message input area instead of in a dropdown menu

**User-visible outcome:** Users can access the chat application without any login, and media sharing controls (image upload and GIF picker) are directly visible in the message input area for easier access.
