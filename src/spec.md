# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Reposition message input controls for better layout alignment in the chatroom.

**Planned changes:**
- Move image upload button and microphone button to the left side of the text input field
- Ensure all three elements (image button, microphone button, text input) have matching heights and perfect vertical alignment

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a reorganized message input area with the image and microphone buttons on the left side of the text field, all perfectly aligned at the same height.
