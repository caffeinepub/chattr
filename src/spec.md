# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix styling issues in the chat input area.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the unwanted top border from the chat input area
- Restore the character counter that was accidentally removed

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a cleaner chat input area without the top border, and the character counter will be visible again to help them track message length.
