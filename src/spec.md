# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix image rendering in chatroom messages so uploaded images display correctly.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix image display functionality in chatroom messages to properly render images with imageId
- Ensure MessageBubble components correctly display images uploaded via MessageInput
- Maintain all existing visual styles, layout, and anonymous access patterns

**User-visible outcome:** Users can see images they upload in chatroom messages displayed correctly without any changes to the interface appearance.
