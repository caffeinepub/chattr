# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make progress bars visible and show only during active typing.

**Planned changes:**
- Change username input progress bar fill to use blue accent color (--accent)
- Change room title input progress bar fill to use blue accent color (--accent)
- Show username progress bar only when user is typing in the username field
- Show room title progress bar only when user is typing in the room title field

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see blue progress bars that appear only when typing in username or room title inputs, making character limit feedback clearer and less cluttered.
