Add a check that evaluates whether the room has associated media (image, video, or X post) before rendering the Creator message element. The mediaUrl and mediaType fields from LobbyChatroomCard are already available in the component props and can be used to determine if media exists. Keep all existing thumbnail preview logic, live status indicators, participant counts, and timestamp formatting unchanged."
