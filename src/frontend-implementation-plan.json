      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "In the Lobby (chatroom cards), thumbnails visually show rounded corners for all media types (YouTube/Twitch/Twitter/other), even when the image does not fill the container due to `object-contain`.",
        "No square/uncut corners are visible around thumbnails during normal display or on hover.",
        "Existing hover effects (e.g., image scale on hover) still work and remain clipped within the rounded thumbnail bounds.",
        "Changes are implemented in the existing lobby card thumbnail component (e.g., `frontend/src/components/ChatroomCard.tsx`) without introducing backend changes."

          "description": "Refactor the thumbnail rendering so each thumbnail type (YouTube/Twitch/Twitter/generic media) wraps the <img> and any overlay layers (badges/labels/hover overlays) in a shared rounded container with `overflow-hidden` (e.g., a `div` like `relative h-full w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg`). Move the rounding responsibility to this wrapper (remove/avoid relying on `rounded-lg` directly on the <img>) so object-contain letterboxing/background and hover scale effects remain clipped to the rounded bounds across all thumbnail variants."
