Use Tailwind CSS utility classes or inline styles to enforce uniform height (e.g., h-12 or h-10) across all three elements. Ensure vertical alignment using flex items-center on the parent container. Add consistent spacing (e.g., gap-2) between elements to maintain visual harmony. Verify that button padding and text input padding are adjusted to match the unified height while preserving click/tap target sizes."
